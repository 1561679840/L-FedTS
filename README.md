## Abstract:
Edge devices provide a new application scenario for federated learning but also exacerbate the heterogeneity among clients in federated learning. In the training process of federated learning, due to
device and data heterogeneity, existing FL mechanisms still face challenges such as long interaction times and poor quality of aggregated model updates. This paper proposes a Loss-based screening
supplementary strategy to optimize the quality of data combinations and ensure the convergence efficiency of global model training.
